Simple Interest Calculator:

This is a simple interest calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows the user to input the principal amount, interest rate, and time period, and calculates the total interest and total amount payable based on the inputs.

The Simple Interest Calculator is a web application that calculates the total amount to be paid based on the principal amount, rate of interest, and duration of the loan. The user can input the principal amount, rate of interest, and duration of the loan, and the calculator will output the total amount to be paid.

The calculator is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML code creates the structure of the calculator, defining the input fields, labels, and buttons. The CSS code defines the styling and layout of the calculator, including colors, fonts, and positioning. The JavaScript code handles the calculations and updates the output based on user input.

The calculator takes input from the user through three input fields: principal amount, rate of interest, and duration of the loan. The principal amount is the amount of money borrowed, the rate of interest is the percentage of interest charged on the loan, and the duration of the loan is the time period over which the loan is repaid. The duration can be specified in either years or months.

The JavaScript code defines a function that is called when the user clicks the "Calculate" button. This function retrieves the input values from the input fields, calculates the simple interest based on the rate of interest and duration, and adds the simple interest to the principal amount to get the total amount to be paid. The function then updates the output on the webpage with the calculated values.

Overall, the Simple Interest Calculator is a useful tool for anyone who wants to calculate the total amount to be paid on a loan based on the principal amount, rate of interest, and duration. It provides a quick and easy way to perform these calculations without the need for complex mathematical formulas or spreadsheets.
